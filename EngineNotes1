Each rendered object uses a pipeline; 
we only have a finite and static set of available pipelines, by default

We keep a structure of objects to be rendered, i.e. the context array

The user should only be able of running:

- DrawGeneric --> for procedural mesh generation

- uploadMesh --> preloading a model, that we can move around / rotate / transformate

It doesn't know anything about the rendering context array

drawGeneric(vertices, indices, pipeline*): generics.push(Generic(vertices, indices, pipeline))

we keep an array of generics:

In the drawLoop: 

for each generic:
	- create the buffer
	- copy it
	- render it
	- destroy it
